        <p> I have many passions in my life but none as great as my passion for music.
          It is the last thing on my mind when I fall asleep,
          the first thing on my mind in the morning and
          it wakes me up in the middle of the night.
          Working in music sets
          my soul at rest and my heart on fire. </P>

          <p> In 2019, I worked closely with an executive team to handle the ins and outs of Artist Relations surrounding III Points Music Festival in Wynwood. I was blessed to work with an incredible team of festival producers, dozens of talented
            artists and bring my own talents to the table. I aided in relations between the artist and the festival for several major artists including Tyler the Creator, Beach House and The Internet. Additionally, I made decisions in the set up of
            artist green rooms, managed supplies and supported stage managers across 7 stages. Working with this festival was a well-rounded experience, requiring me to spend time both in the field and in an office setting. I was able to learn a lot
            about Redbull Sponsorship at this event and worked closely with the Redbull promotional team to supply every artist with a Redbull and promotional displays.</p>
